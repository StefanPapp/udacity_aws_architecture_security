# Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Drilling down into the tools, we see that the cloudformation templates included various vulnerabilities

S3: 4 compliance rules are not compliant. These are rulles about encryption and logging
Ec2: 2 compliance rultes that they are not managed by SSM and not enforcign imsdv2
Ec2: SSH is open to the world

# Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

S3: Activate S3 ServerSide encryption and enforce encryption in transit with S3 Bucket policies. Enable logging
EC2: Change the EC2 Metadata to enforce v2, consider installing agents to use SSM for manage EC2 instances
EC2: Apply the security as shown in the later exercises to avoid SSH access via password. Restrict access not to 0.0.0.0/0, but to ip ranged that will be used to SSH.
