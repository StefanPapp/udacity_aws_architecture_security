# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
There was a brute force attacks as seen in the screenshot (in the last 12 minutes).


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
AWS Guardduty uses anomaly detection to detect attacks. If there is a huge number of ssh attempts it is a strong indication that it is brute force attack

Data Sources are: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs

According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html#guardduty_data-sources.title
there are five data sources

* AWS CloudTrail Event Logs
* AWS CloudTrail Management Events
* AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Events
* VPC Flow Logs
* DNS logs

As Cloudtrail is focussed on API calls, VPC Flow Logs data will indicate that there was an attack attempt.
