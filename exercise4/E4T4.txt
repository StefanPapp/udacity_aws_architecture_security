# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Not using private IPs. Closing as much ports as possible. AWS WAF

Yes.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The environment would be set back to the state what the cloud formation template describes
